# Pure Service Orchestrator (PSO) CSI Driver

## What is PSO?

Pure Service Orchestrator (PSO) delivers storage-as-a-service for containers, giving developers the agility of public cloud with the reliability and security of on-premises infrastructure.

**Smart Provisioning**<br/>
PSO automatically makes the best provisioning decision for each storage request – in real-time – by assessing multiple factors such as performance load, the capacity and health of your arrays, and policy tags.

**Elastic Scaling**<br/>
Uniting all your Pure FlashArray™ and FlashBlade™ arrays on a single shared infrastructure, and supporting file and block as needed, PSO makes adding new arrays effortless, so you can scale as your environment grows.

**Transparent Recovery**<br/>
To ensure your services stay robust, PSO self-heals – so you’re protected against data corruption caused by issues such as node failure, array performance limits, and low disk space.

  - Latest Filesystem utilities/drivers (XFS by default, Required)
  - Latest iSCSI initiator software for your operating system (Optional, required for iSCSI connectivity)
  - Latest NFS software package for your operating system (Optional, required for NFS connectivity)
  - Latest FC initiator software for your operating system (Optional, required for FC connectivity, *FC Supported on Bare-metal K8s installations only*)
  - An NTP implementation (such as `ntpd` or `chronyd`) is installed and running on all Kubernetes cluster nodes.
- #### FlashArray and FlashBlade:
  - The FlashArray and/or FlashBlade should be connected to the worker nodes using [Pure's best practices](https://support.purestorage.com/Solutions/Linux/Reference/Linux_Recommended_Settings)
- #### FlashArray User Privilages
  - It is recommend to use a specific FlashArray user, and associated API token, for PSO access control to enable easier array auditing.
  - The PSO user can be local or based on a Directory Service controlled account (assuming DS is configured on the array).
  - The PSO user requires a minimum role level of `storage_admin`.
- #### FlashBlade User Privileges
  - If the FlashBlade is configured to use Directory Services for array management, then a DS controlled account and its associated API token can be used for PSO.
  - The PSO user requires a minimum array management role level of `storage_admin`.
  - Currently there is no option to create additional local users on a FlashBlade.

## Hardware Pre-Requisites

PSO can be used with any of the following hardware appliances and associated minimum version of appliance code:
  - Pure Storage FlashArray (minimum Purity code version 4.8)
      - minimum Purity v5.3.0 required to support the Storage QoS featureset
  - Pure Storage FlashBlade (minimum Purity version 2.2.0)

## Installation

PSO is deployed using Helm chart. Looking for the old PSO 5.x version? Check [here](https://github.com/purestorage/helm-charts).

### Helm

If your Kubernetes deployment does not include Helm3 by default, then refer to the [Helm Installation](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/) documentation.

#### PSO Helm Chart

The **pureStorageDriver** helm chart deploys PSO CSI plugin on your Kubernetes cluster.

Refer to the [pureStorageDriver README](./pureStorageDriver/README.md) for the full installation process.
